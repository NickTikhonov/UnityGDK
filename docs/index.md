# SpatialOS Unity GDK documentation

#### Warning
**Warning:** The [pre-alpha](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/release-policy#maturity-stages) release is for evaluation purposes only, with limited documentation - see the guidance on [Recommended use](https://github.com/spatialos/UnityGDK#recommended-use).

#### How to get started
We recommend you start by following the [Installation and setup guide]({{urlRoot}}/setup-and-installing.md) to set up the GDK Core and its accompanying example scene, the Playground. You can then explore what the Unity GDK Core does from there. Use the [Unity GDK: Contents](#contents) documentation, listed below, to explore how the GDK Core works.

Note that the Unity GDK documentation assumes that you are familiar with SpatialOS concepts and the Unity ECS.

We want your feedback on the Unity GDK, its documentation and its [roadmap (Trello board)](https://trello.com/b/29tMKyQC) - see [Give us feedback](https://github.com/spatialos/UnityGDK#give-us-feedback).
